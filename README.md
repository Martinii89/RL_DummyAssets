# RL_DummyAssets

## A Word from Martinn

Theres just too many here for me to test each individually. Let me know if any of these are giving you problems.

It's fairly easy to generate new ones, so if there's anything important missing. Just let me know and I'll add them.

## Generating Dummy Assets

After downloading this repository, you will also need to head to either the Rocket League Mapmaking Discord or Rocket League Mods Discord. Both have a resident bot named RLAESKeyBot which provides the files and programs needed to generate Dummy Assets.

Move the DummyExtract.bat script into the same directory as AssetExtraction.exe, set the correct file paths within the script, and you're all set!
